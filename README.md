# ProjectLocus
The effective or perceived location of something abstract.

A multi-platform multiplayer PvP arena shooter built using technologies like Java, libGDX and KryoNet.

A stupidly simple and fun local multiplayer arena shooter with no purpose. This is just a proof of concept game and a better highly polished version of the same is in the works.

There are three simple types of ships to choose from - Assault, Tank and Agile. All have their own unique attack power, strength and speed.

A maximum of 8 players can join the arena at a time.
